an employee data analyzer system allows us to manage and analyze employee data, such as names, departments, and salaries, in an organized and efficient way. This project helps us to learn important Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, handling exceptions, multithreading, and data manipulation.

Working of Employee Data Analyzer:

-First, we will declare an Employee class which represents the employee's details like ID, name, departement, and salary.

-We define EmployeeManager class, which will manage employee data by adding, retrieving, filtering, and sorting employee details.

-We will use the most important concept which is multithreading in Java, it is used to make the system more efficient and to process employee data concurrently. Each employee's data will be processed in separate threads.

-Weâ€™ll also implement error handling using custom exceptions, so that we can properly handle cases where an employee's data is not found.
